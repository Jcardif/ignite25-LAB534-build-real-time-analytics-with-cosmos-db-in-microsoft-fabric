# Implement Reverse ETL and Build Personalization Model

In this exercise, you will create a Dataflow Gen2 to extract and transform data from the Eventhouse, update the user profiles in Cosmos DB, and then use that data to build a personalization model in a notebook.

by the end of this exercise, you'll be able to:
- Use Fabric Notebooks to extract and transform data, and build a personalization model
- Perform Reverse ETL to update user profiles in Cosmos DB

## Create Data Warehouse Views

1. In your Fabric workspace, navigate to the Data Warehouse where you want to create views.
1. Create a new SQL query by selecting the **New SQL Query** button in the warehouse page.

1. In the query window editor, paste the following SQL code to create views in the warehouse:

+++*CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vDimCustomerKey AS
SELECT CustomerId, CustomerKey, IsActive FROM dbo.DimCustomer;

CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vDimShopKey AS
SELECT ShopId, ShopKey, IsActive FROM dbo.DimShop;

CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vDimMenuItemKey AS
SELECT MenuItemId, MenuItemKey, IsActive FROM dbo.DimMenuItem;

CREATE OR ALTER VIEW dbo.vFactSalesMaxKey AS
SELECT
  MaxSalesKey = COALESCE(MAX(SalesKey), 0),
  ExistingTxnCount = COUNT(*)
FROM dbo.FactSales;*+++

1. Select **Run** to execute the query and create the views in the warehouse.
